newsletter subscription

This is a simple newsletter subscription page created with express and node js, along with simple bootstrap html and css elements.
The newsletter captures the first, last name and email address and saves it in mailchimp and a success or failure message is displayed once the
button is submitted.
This is part of my learning. Any suggestions are welcome.
